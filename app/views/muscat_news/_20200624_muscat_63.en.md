## Welcome to the new Muscat release 6.3!

Muscat 6.3 is the release for July 2020 and brings numerous enhancements. The most prominent features include more updated and corrected translations and some field rearrangements that create an environment that is easier to work in.

* Field 033 has been completely removed; dates related to performances are no longer encoded. Use a 518 note for any performance information. Data previously in this field has been moved to a General Note.

* The function Associated name (asn) was added to 710 $4 for Sources and Holdings
* The field groups in the secondary literature have been rearranged to better follow the cataloguing workflow
* It is now possible to create new people directly from the secondary literature interface
