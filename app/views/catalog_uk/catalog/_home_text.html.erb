The simple search mode is the easiest way to start a search. Because the search is performed in all fields, this method often produces a long list of results. You can then refine your search by applying any of the additional terms listed on the left. Alternatively you may simply use one or more of the refining terms as your first search.
</p>


<p class="welcome-tip">A search with more than one word will find only the sources that match <strong>all</strong> the criteria. The words do not have to be in the same field..</p>

<p class="welcome-tip">Phrases, or expressions, can be given between quotes: for example <strong>"keyboard concerto"</strong>.</p>

<p class="welcome-tip">All the different options can be combined. For example <strong>"sacred songs" GB-DRc </strong> matches all the sources of Durham Cathedral Library with sacred songs.</p>
