We are pleased to announce the launch of the Muscat Project website! It includes information pages about the features and the current developments.

The website now includes a news section where we will be able to keep you up-to-date with our latest achievements. On the database front-end side, there is a new <a href="{{ site.search_url }}?locale=en">faceted search</a> functionality that makes it easy to browse or search and filter the database. The <a href="{{ site.advanced_search_url }}?locale=en">advanced search</a> option provides refined access to the data.
