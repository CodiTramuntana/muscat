        <h5>Mentions in comments</h5>
        <p>
            Comments are more interactive in Muscat 5.0 with the option to use @mentions for addressing other Muscat users directly. Typing the @ will trigger a list of users to be displayed. Users mentioned in a comment will be notified by e-mail and will also receive further notification when additional comments are entered for a resource.

        <h5>Filtering by number of copies</h5>
        <p>
            In Muscat discovery interface it is now possible to filter by number of copies for the prints. This makes it possible, for example, to retrieve a list of prints inventoried only in two libraries, or the list of unica for a particular library.

<h5>Notifications</h5>

<p>
    For people wishing to follow additions and modifications in Muscat, it is time-consuming and unrealistic to have to keep checking it occasionally to see if a source or another entry has been added or modified. The version of Muscat (5.0) includes the ability to create alerts following the creation or modification of entries. Alerts are set with patterns and fields. For example, a user might want to create an alert for sources matching a certain library sigla and/or a shelfmark, or sources composed by a certain composer. Once this is set in the user profile, the user receives weekly notifications with a list of created and modified entries matching the alert.

<h5>Collections of holdings</h5>

<p>
    Muscat 5.0 allows for holding items (copies of a print) to be included in a collection. This can be useful for projects willing to provide an in-depth description of how their prints are bound together in a particular collection. It can also be used for describing manuscript collection containing also printed material. See for example the collection <a href="https://muscat.rism.info/admin/sources/1001056386" target="_blank">1001056386</a>, which contains two holdings of a print.
