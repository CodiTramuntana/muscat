= Installation instructions

This document describes how to bootstrap into the webapplication.

* ruby: 1.9.3

This document describes the installation process on FreeBSD using ports, other systems are tested (MacOS X and Linux), 
and it is important that the various package versions match.

== Preliminaries

The following other libraries and programs are needed

* Apache 2.2
* MySQL > 5.0
* iconv
* Git

Git is necessary for checking out the repo, so install it if necessary:

	cd /usr/ports/devel/git
	sudo make install clean

Install iconv (for rails, used by ruby-iconv):

	cd /usr/ports/converters/iconv
	sudo make install clean
	# gem is dumb, need symlinks....
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/libiconv.* /usr/lib
	ln -s /usr/local/include/iconv.h /usr/include/

Install MySQL:

	cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql51-server
	make install clean
	# Remember to enable it in /etc/rc.conf
	# mysql_enable="YES"
	# and launch it:
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server start

Install Apache 2.2:

	cd /usr/ports/www/apache22
	make install clean
	# Edit /etc/rc.conf and add for automatic startup:
	# accf_http_load="YES"     
	# apache22_enable="YES"

== Ruby and Rails

Version 1.9.3 of Ruby is used. On FreeBSD:

	cd /usr/ports/lang/ruby19/
	sudo make install clean

Install Gem:

	cd /usr/ports/devel/ruby-gems
	sudo make install clean

Install rails (4.0):

	sudo gem install rails

Lastly install Passenger (3.0):

	gem install passenger
	passenger-install-apache2-module

== Bootstrap the application

Get the sources if necessary (https://github.com/rism-ch/muscat):

	git clone https://github.com/rism-ch/muscat.git

Use bundle to install all the gems for the app:

	sudo bundle install

Install base configuration:

	cd muscat/config
	cp sample_database.yml database.yml
	cp sample_application.rb application.rb

Install the base css:

	cd muscat/config
	cp muscat-custom-sample.scss ../app/assets/stylesheets/muscat-custom.scss

Set up databases access:

	mysql
	> CREATE DATABASE muscat_development CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
	> CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost';
	> SET PASSWORD FOR 'username'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('pass');
	> GRANT ALL ON muscat_development.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
	# Remember
	# username and pass should be the same as in database.yml

Migrate the database:

	cd trunk/
	rake db:migrate
	

Add basic dataset:

	rake db:seed
	
Default (development) startup:

	./bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
	./rails s -e

For startup in production mode:

	./bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production assets:precompile
	./bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production sunspot:solr:start
	./rails s -e production
	
Try to open ::

	http://ip:3000/

==== Index rebuilding:

	rake sunspot:reindex

Specify only a model:

	rake sunspot:reindex[,Person]
	
Do reindex in 1 record batches, useful if reindex crashes to see in which one (very slow to start)

	rake sunspot:reindex[1]

==== Updating from an older version of Muscat

For upgrading from an older version, see the {5- UPGRADE}[link:5-%20UPGRADE_rdoc.html] page.
	 
==== To install on Mac OS X Lion

With MySQL 64 bit binaries, add:

	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"


== Basic Apache configuration

Example Apache configuration:

	# create /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes/default.conf
	# and add default site:
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	        # ServerName www..org
	        DocumentRoot /var/rails/rism-ch/public
	        <Directory "/var/rails/rism-ch/public">
	                Options All -Indexes +ExecCGI -Includes +MultiViews
	                AllowOverride All
	                Order allow,deny
	                Allow from all
	        </Directory>
	        RailsEnv development
	</VirtualHost>
	
Double check permissions:

	# Create /var/rails and populate with software
	mkdir /var/rails
	<command to checkout as needed TBD>
	chown -R www /var/rails

Start Apache and Ferretd:

	# REMEMBER, check that the hostname resolves!
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache22 start
	cd /var/rails/rism-ch/
	./script/ferretd/start
	
If all this works, you can access the rism application ::

	<tt>http://ip</tt>
	
== Adding users

The first user needs to be set from the commandline:

	cd housekeeping/admin
	ruby create_admin_users.rb -a --username USER --password PASS --email EMAIL
	
the <tt>-a</tt> flag marks the user as admin
