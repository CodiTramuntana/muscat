= RSPEC

This software has a suite of spec tests in the 'spec' folder. 

Before strating the suite solr should be started in the test environment:

  RAILS_ENV=test rake sunspot:solr:start

Then to execute the complete suite call:
  
  bundle exec rspec -fd

After finishing the sunspot session could be stopped:

  RAILS_ENV=test rake sunspot:solr:stop
